# Summary  
A large island trading empire. Actually a misnomer as there are no dragons. Standing is very important and follows a set of arcane rules difficult for outsiders to understand. The rumour is that the current emperor is mad. They fight with highly skilled and disciplined troops who fight in organised regiments.  
  
# Honour  
All members of the Dragon Empire have an honour price. This is the price one must pay if they insult or injure another party. You gain honour price by having more dependants and serfs, you lose honour the same way - or by court reducing your honour as a result of a social infraction. Honour is zero sum, you gain honour only by taking it from another.  Based on Irish mediaeval systems.
