#faction
A confederation of noble houses 
# Summary
A collection of numerous autonomous Houses that live upon fertile vast grasslands. Together they form less of a unified nation and more of a federation of similar interests. Each House may have different laws and saints but they are unified by their Dawn Orthodoxy religion.

Notable for fielding bands of mercenary soldiers based around a single noble prince supported by a cadre of clones, each specialised to a different purpose.
