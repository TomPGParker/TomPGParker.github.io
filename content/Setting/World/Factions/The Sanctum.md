The last refuge of wizards. The people of Sanctum travel the world largely unbothered 

# Summary
Last refuge of true high magic. Very few people live in this city upon the cliffs and no outsiders are welcome. Most things that are known about The Sanctum are from its members "holidaying" in the outside world, generally to the detriment of wherever they happen to be as they consider themselves to be above outsider law. Taking the magics of The Sanctum with them, these tourists are generally untouchable.
