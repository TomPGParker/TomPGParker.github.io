## [Dragon Empire](./Dragon%20Empire.md)  
# Summary  
A large island trading empire. Actually a misnomer as there are no dragons. Standing is very important and follows a set of arcane rules difficult for outsiders to understand. The rumour is that the current emperor is mad. They fight with highly skilled and disciplined troops who fight in organised regiments.  
  
  
  
## [Dawn Houses](./Dawn%20Houses/Dawn%20Houses.md)  
# Summary  
A collection of numerous autonomous Houses that live upon fertile vast grasslands. Together they form less of a unified nation and more of a federation of similar interests. Each House may have different laws and saints but they are unified by their Dawn Orthodoxy religion.  
  
Notable for fielding bands of mercenary soldiers based around a single noble prince supported by a cadre of clones, each specialised to a different purpose.  
  
  
## [The Strand](The%20Strand.md)  
Desert Empire to the far south rich in metals and jewels who make extensive use of slave labour.  
  
## [The True North](./The%20True%20North.md)  
# Summary  
United under a single ruler for the first time they have stormed down the mountains. Hardened by their difficult lives in the mountain ranges they have run out of northern opponents and seek conquest to the south.  
  
Fighting in a tribal structure they are prone to fighting amongst themselves.  
  
  
## [The Sanctum](./The%20Sanctum.md)  
# Summary  
Last refuge of true high magic. Very few people live in this city upon the cliffs and no outsiders are welcome. Most things that are known about The Sanctum are from its members "holidaying" in the outside world, generally to the detriment of wherever they happen to be as they consider themselves to be above outsider law. Taking the magics of The Sanctum with them, these tourists are generally untouchable.
