Originally belonging to [Vincent Bine](Vincent%20Bine.md)'s assistant [Tomas](Tomas.md).  
  
Contains three passages that can be decoded. All three have now been decoded.  
  
**Sacrifice Flow**   
1. Potential sacrifices arrive at the tomb and drink from the pool  
2. They find an available niche, strip and throw their belongings into the pit (except their item of shame)  
3. Go to the Chapel, to wait for one week  
4. St. Anya tries to remind them of their value, giving them three chances to break the spell by showing them three acts of self- care the moon has seen them do. However, she may not do this for those who have knowingly perpetuated significant crimes against others (e.g., murderers).  
5. After 7 days the Candlemaker collects them  
6. They are "baptized" in the Moon Pool   
7. Then shrouded, and placed in a niche  
8. They become comatose and are left to "give up" on their life  
9. When a sacrifice gives up completely, their body becomes ethereal and runes appear on them and on the columns by the moon pool. Each sacrifice's item of shame is collected and displayed in the Trophy Suite. The victim must have it to escape.  
  
**Vincent's Extras**  
1. Vincent enchants the candles with Minerva's song to speed up the process of getting sacrifices (-3 to WIS SAVES), which has increased the false positives and potentially slowed down his efforts.  
2. He added the Sand Thresher to protect the Void Pillar. The pillar is virtually indestructible, but he found some dragon bones and couldn't help himself. The Sand Thresher contains a 10,000SP soul stone.  
3. He added the Flesh Golem and brick wall to the Trophy Suite. Disturbing the trophy suite too much will trigger the flesh golem.  
4. The pillar guardian will attack anyone who attempts to steal mundane treasure.  
  
Once the book has been fully decoded is also acts as a casting manual for "Casting Forth the Inner Eye".
