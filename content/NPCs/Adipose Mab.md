## Summary
A wiry, weather-worn woman in her late 30’s with greasy brown hair and black grit in the lines of her face, Mab looks little like a scholar. She prefers to think of herself as an explorer and tomb robber— though she’s never worn the guild’s stone skull mask. A canny researcher and decent leader, Mab uses her knowledge of the [Crystal Tombs](Crystal%20Tombs.md) to take a slice of others’ labor. Her terms are harsh, but she doesn’t cheat her employees, and is willing to work amicably with others because of her conviction that she’ll always be able to find another site to plunder, or angle to exploit. Mab wants to be rich, and she is by Crystal Bay standards, but still far too poor for a retirement in sybaritic [Dawn Rill](Dawn%20Rill.md). Mab is regularly accompanied by her personal gemcutter [Flash](Flash.md) and their bodyguards [Kotto](Kotto.md) and [Carrow](Carrow.md) (Dopplesoldats of Blue Meadows). 

She's currently taken up residence in the [[Red Squirrel Inn|Red Squirrel Inn]].
