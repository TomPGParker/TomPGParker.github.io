# When Downtime Occurs  
Every time a mission based adventure is completed (or abandoned) the party gets Downtime. This Downtime period usually represents about a month before the next adventure in my game. If an adventure or mission takes longer, players get a bonus Downtime activity for every ~3 sessions of adventuring without a Downtime. This doesn’t make much sense from a diegetic standpoint but exists to not penalize the amount of Downtime received and keep it relevant in the game if particular adventures or missions can’t be easily compressed into 1-2 sessions.  
  
# The Roll  
**Roll 2d6 + Attribute + Relevant Skill**  
  
<7: Failure: There’s a complication and/or it doesn’t work.    
7-9: Basic or Mixed Success: It works but there’s probably a complication.    
10-11: Expert Success: It works!    
12-13: Master Success: It works and an extra good thing!    
14+: Legendary Success: It works and some really good stuff

## [Research](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/downtime/#research)  
A character answers a single question about a bit of lost or forgotten lore, the location of a lost item, the whereabouts of an important NPC, and so on. To take this action the player must have a clearly formulated question they’d like to answer, and a **Source** of knowledge in the game world that their character can interact with. If the PC does not have a **Source**, then they can spend a **Downtime Action** trying to find one. There is no guarantee that they will be successful. Once a question is posed and an appropriate **Source** has been identified, the **Warden** should provide any **Milestones** and associated **Costs**.  
  
## [QUESTIONS](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/downtime/#questions)  
As always, the question must come from an experience that occurred during play. Some example questions:  
  
- “Where is the **Lost Temple of East Nipoor**?”  
- “Who in **Fortune City** might know how to crack an ancient vault?”  
- “Where can I find the cure to **curly sickness**?”  
## [SOURCES](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/downtime/#sources)  
A **Source** is a person, place, faction, or entity that holds either a part or whole answer that the character seeks. They can be NPCs, Factions, spirits, or even other PCs.  
  
Example **Sources**:  
  
- **Kewr the Mouth**, a frequent contact for the **Conclave of Merchants**. Despite their excellent relationship with this faction, asking for help in an illicit activity might come at a high cost.  
- A **Woodwose** who makes his home deep in the **Forest of Knives**. The party encountered him in an earlier expedition and the meeting did not end well. Still, he is said to know the nature of every herb and their healing properties.  
- The **Temple of Puppets**, a nomadic circus troupe who have travelled the known and unknown lands. The party assisted one of their members during the **Rain of Fire**, when even the creatures of the Wood were preparing to flee their homes. If anyone has heard of forgotten places, it’s them.  
  
## [Strengthening Ties](https://cairnrpg.com/wip/2e/downtime/#strengthening-ties)  
A character fosters a connection with an NPC or Faction in the game world. First, they must identify the entity with whom they wish to strengthen ties, as well as a specific **intent** (e.g., building trust, mending a friendship, seeking membership in a Faction, forming an alliance, and so on). The **Warden** then provides concrete measures (described as **Milestones** and **Costs**) that the PC can undertake to advance the relationship. With each completed **Milestone**, the **Warden** describes how the PC’s relationship has grown or changed.  
  
Examples:  
  
- After returning from an unsuccessful delve into the **Roots**, a PC discovers that they’d unknowingly brought along a stowaway: an eyeless devourer, barely hatched. They decide to keep the creature and train it in secret.  
- During a play session, a PC becomes friendly with the **Seneschal** of the **Order of the Helm**. Impressed by the Order’s values, the PC asks what the requirements are to join.  
- A powerful **Seneschal** died during the **Battle of Frogs** while under the party’s care. Now those responsible wish to provide redress, so that the party can once again perform tasks for that Faction.
