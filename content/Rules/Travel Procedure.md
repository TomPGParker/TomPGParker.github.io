## Watches  
While traveling, days are divided into six four-hour watches: three for day, three for night. Most major actions (traveling, foraging, searching etc.) take one watch to complete  
  
## Travel Speed  
PCs can move 10km (one hex) per watch, up to three times per day. Each watch they travel after the third deals 1 direct damage to each PC unless they succeed at a CON check.  
  
Speed is halved in:  
- darkness  
- difficult terrain  
- severe weather  
Speed is doubled when:  
- riding  
- following a road  
  
## Navigation  
If the terrain or weather while traveling is disorienting, the GM may require a WIS check of the party’s leader (which the GM rolls in secret) to see if they move to a random adjacent hex.   
  
## Exploring  
The party can spend a watch exploring the area of a 10km hex to reveal any areas of interest (such as an overgrown ruin, hidden pool, etc.) that wouldn’t be noticed by passing through.   
  
## Secret features  
Secret features (such as buried treasure or a hidden door into a mountain) should have corresponding clues revealed by exploring the hex. They can only be found by the PCs interacting with the game world.  
  
## Foraging  
Finding food takes a watch and requires passing a WIS check, with modifiers for weather, terrain, etc. On a success, a PC collects d6 rations.  
  
## The Travel Hazard Die  
At the end of each watch, roll the Travel Hazard Die and apply the result.  
  
## Travel Hazard  
Roll 1d6 and apply the results  
1. Encounter  
2. Sign of encounter  
3. Fatigue - spend the next watch resting take 1 system strain  
4. Depletion - roll d6 for each perishable item. On a 1 it has gone bad.  
5. Weather shift - the weather changers or a local event occurs.  
6. Free. No effect.  
  
## Notes  
-Depletion does not occur when travelling in a caravan.
